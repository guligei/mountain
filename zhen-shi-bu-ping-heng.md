# 真实不平衡



**happen 69, respect 99 with emotion, 69 it's true after analysis with peace.**

* wage可感知的不平衡，可感知的 idle，
* 股价，flow flow flow，
* 为什么想通了，就不痛了呢，就疏解了呢，
* 精神流到了死胡同里面，一种合理的解释，合理本身意味着接受，而情绪的产生在于始料未及，如果世界发生的，跟你预期的保持一致，你就会很自然和平静，一切在预料之中，你应该像水一样流经，
* 你不知道谁会对什么信息进行排斥，每一句带有感情色彩的话都是一条黑盒测试的case，除非你对一个人充分了解
* 我知道他们的反应，产生反应，并且做出可以接受合理的解释，可以疏解，平衡情绪反应

> if you are real busy ,you will have no time to wash pear, if you are real busy, you have no time to eat pear. in other words, if you have time ,do you will to wash pear. you will not ,you will not eat but to wash pear. because pear is bought by you, if you wash ,you will have heart unbalance .if you not wash you always have unbalance ,because you do not want to eat pear only yourself. just my thinking. for most of all, when we have something to eat ,if we see familiar employee, we will feel bad if we not give it to them to eat ,but if we give them we will feel bad also, so we do not want to into contradictory situation
